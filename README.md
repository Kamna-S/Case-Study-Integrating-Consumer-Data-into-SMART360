# Case-Study-Integrating-Consumer-Data-into-SMART360

Here's the documentation with emojis as pointers:

👩‍💻 Python Scripts Documentation

📝 Data Extraction Script
🎯 Purpose: Extract consumer data from the ABC Utility Company's database.
📥 Input: Database connection details (host, database name, user, password).
📤 Output: A collection of consumer data records.
📚 Dependencies: psycopg2 library (PostgreSQL database adapter for Python).

📝 Data Mapping Script
🎯 Purpose: Map the extracted consumer data to the SMART360 consumer table fields.
📥 Input: The extracted consumer data.
📤 Output: A transformed DataFrame containing the mapped consumer data.
📚 Dependencies: pandas library.

📝 Transformation and Loading Script
🎯 Purpose: Transform the mapped consumer data and load it into the SMART360 consumer table.
📥 Input: The transformed DataFrame containing the mapped consumer data, SMART360 database connection details.
📤 Output: Consumer data loaded into the SMART360 consumer table.
📚 Dependencies: psycopg2 library.

📝 Validation and Testing Script
🎯 Purpose: Perform validation checks on the integrated consumer data in the SMART360 consumer table.
📥 Input: SMART360 database connection details.
📤 Output: Validation results (e.g., record count, data integrity checks).
📚 Dependencies: psycopg2 library.

🧪 Testing and Validation Documentation

📊 Record Count Validation
🎯 Check the count of records inserted into the SMART360 consumer table.
✅ Expected Result: The record count should match the number of consumer records extracted from the ABC Utility Company's database.

🔍 Data Integrity Checks
- 🔑 Verify that the 'Consumer ID' field in the SMART360 consumer table is unique and not null.
- ✔️ Validate that the 'First Name', 'Last Name', and 'Address Line 1' fields are not null.
- ✉️ Ensure that the 'Phone Number' and 'Email Address' fields conform to the expected formats.

🔍 Data Quality Checks
- ❌ Check for any invalid or missing values in the SMART360 consumer table fields.
- ⚠️ Identify and report any potential data inconsistencies or anomalies.

🚀 Deployment Documentation

⏰ Scheduling Mechanism
- 🔄 The data integration process should be scheduled to run periodically (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly) based on the requirements.
- ⏱️ Use a task scheduler or a cron job to automate the execution of the Python scripts.

📦 Environment Setup
- 📥 Ensure that the required Python libraries (psycopg2, pandas) are installed in the execution environment.
- 🔌 Configure the database connection details (host, database name, user, password) for both the ABC Utility Company's database and the SMART360 database.

📝 Logging and Monitoring
- 🚨 Implement logging mechanisms to capture any errors, warnings, or relevant information during the data integration process.
- 📬 Set up monitoring tools or alerts to receive notifications in case of script failures or any issues during the data integration process.

⚙️ Maintenance and Updates
- 🔄 Establish a process for regularly reviewing and updating the data integration scripts to accommodate any changes in the source or target data structures, or to address any identified issues or performance bottlenecks.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the data integration process, including the data mapping plan, Python script descriptions, testing and validation procedures, and deployment guidelines. It serves as a reference for understanding the overall workflow and ensuring a smooth and efficient integration of consumer data into the SMART360 platform.
